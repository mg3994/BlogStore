# Migrating from go_router to kaisel

If you're reading this, you've already decided — or mostly decided —
that you want to move. This guide is the practical work: what
translates, what doesn't, and what the diff against your existing
codebase will look like. It isn't a sales pitch for kaisel (that's
the [Routes as Values][1] article) and it isn't a list of grievances
against go_router. Pragmatic translation, honest about effort.

## The short version

go_router thinks in string paths matched against a route table.
kaisel thinks in sealed values that are the source of truth, with
URLs derived from them by a codec when you need URLs at all. The
gap between these mental models is wider than the gap from auto_route
to kaisel, and the migration is correspondingly more philosophical
in places.

The *surface*, though, is now close. kaisel has a
`KaiselRouterConfig` that drops into `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig:)`
exactly where `GoRouter` does, declared as a top-level `final` with
no `StatefulWidget` or hand-rolled delegate. And it has terse
`context.*` verbs — `context.push(const ProductDetail('42'))`,
`context.pop()`, `context.set([...])` — that mirror go_router's
`context.push('/path')` shape. So the day-to-day call sites read
almost the same; what changes is what flows through them (typed
values instead of strings).

The mechanical translation is straightforward for simple apps. The
work concentrates in three areas: the global `redirect:` callback
(becomes a guard pipeline), `ShellRoute` / `StatefulShellRoute`
(becomes `KaiselBranchedShell`, with state preservation as the
default rather than as the stateful variant), and the URL story
(string patterns disappear; a codec replaces them).

For an app of about thirty screens with one shell and a redirect-based
auth flow, plan three to four days. Most of that is mechanical;
the slow part is testing that deep-link parity still holds.

## Before you start

A few questions worth answering honestly before you begin.

**Are you using `StatefulShellRoute` or the older non-stateful `ShellRoute`?**
If non-stateful, your app probably treats tab switches as losing
intra-tab navigation state. kaisel's branched shell preserves
per-tab state by default — your tabs will behave differently after
migration. Decide whether that's the new desired behavior, or
whether you need to actively reset stacks on tab switches to
preserve current UX.

**Does your app rely on go_router's `extra` field for non-serializable
payloads?** kaisel doesn't have an equivalent — instead, you put
the data on the route directly. That's cleaner, but it means routes
that carry rich payloads can't be roundtripped through URLs (which
is honest — they couldn't be roundtripped through go_router's
`extra` field either, despite the API suggesting they could).

**Do you rely on browser history / deep linking in production?**
If yes, the codec is a load-bearing piece of the migration and worth
writing carefully. If no, you can use a no-op parser and skip the
codec entirely.

## Concept mapping

| `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: _router)`     | `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: _config)`         |
| `GoRoute(path: '/products/:id', builder: ...)`  | `final class ProductDetail extends AppRoute` + a switch arm |
| Path params `:id` parsed to `state.params['id']`| Constructor field `final String id`                 |
| Query params `state.uri.queryParameters`        | Constructor fields on the route                     |

| Global `redirect: (ctx, state) => ...`          | Guard function `(current, proposed) → stack` in the pipeline |
| Per-route `redirect:`                           | Same pipeline; pattern-match on the route           |

| `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`               | `KaiselBranchedShell.specs` with N branches (`lazy: true` for go_router-style lazy branches; `KaiselBranchSpec.deferred` to code-split a tab) |
| `context.push('/products/42')`                  | `context.push(const ProductDetail('42'))`           |
| `await context.push<T>('/edit')` (returns a value) | `await context.pushForResult<T>(const Edit())` — typed result from a main-stack screen, resolved with `context.pop(value)` |
| `context.go('/products/42')`                    | `context.set([const Home(), ProductDetail('42')])` (replace stack) or `context.replaceTop(...)` |
| `context.pop()`                                 | `context.pop()` (also closes a sheet/dialog from inside one — see the note below) |
| `context.replace('/login')`                     | `context.replaceTop(const Login())`                 |
| `go_router_builder` (optional codegen)          | Sealed types; no build step                         |
| `errorBuilder:`                                 | An error route variant in your sealed type          |
| `GoRouter(observers: [analytics])`              | `KaiselRouterConfig(observers: () => [analytics()])` — a builder; called once per navigator so each gets its own instance |
| `ShellRoute(observers: [...])`                  | Same `observers:` builder — it already reaches every shell branch, module, and flow navigator |

A row-by-row read can hide the conceptual shift: the left column
treats URLs as the primary representation; the right column treats
sealed values as primary. Everything else cascades from that
distinction.

## The migration in six steps

### 1. Project setup

Swap go_router for kaisel in `pubspec.yaml`:

```diff
 dependencies:
   flutter:
     sdk: flutter
-  go_router: ^14.0.0
+  kaisel: ^1.0.0
```

If you used `go_router_builder` for typed routes, drop both that and
`build_runner` (if it isn't being used by something else). Delete
any generated `*.g.dart` files associated with routing.

Then replace the `GoRouter` instance itself. Where go_router has a
top-level `final _router = GoRouter(...)` plugged into
`MaterialApp.router(routerConfig:)`, kaisel has a top-level
`final _config = KaiselRouterConfig<AppRoute>(...)` that fills the
exact same slot:

**Before** (go_router):

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  initialLocation: '/home',
  routes: [/* GoRoutes */],
);

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  const App({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) =>
      MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: _router);
}
```

**After** (kaisel):

```dart
final _config = KaiselRouterConfig<AppRoute>(
  initial: const Home(),
  builder: (context, route) => switch (route) {
    Home() => const HomeScreen(),
    ProductList() => const ProductListScreen(),
    ProductDetail(:final id) => ProductDetailScreen(id: id),
    // ... other routes
  },
  // optional: guards:, pageWrapper:, modalBuilder:, codec:, fallback:
);

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  const App({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) =>
      MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: _config);
}
```

Like `GoRouter`, `KaiselRouterConfig` is app-lifetime: a top-level
`final`, no `StatefulWidget`, no manual `KaiselRouterDelegate`, no
hand-rolled parser, no `dispose`. Omit `codec:` and the app is
URL-less; pass `codec:` (and optionally `fallback:`) and it wires the
route-information parser and `PlatformRouteInformationProvider` for
you (step 6). `_config.router` exposes the bundled `KaiselRouter` if
you need imperative access to the stack. The explicit
delegate-plus-parser form still works as a lower tier when you want
to assemble the pieces by hand.

### 2. Translate GoRoute definitions to sealed routes

Each `GoRoute` in your route table becomes a sealed class variant.
The screen widget stays mostly the same — the difference is that
its constructor takes its parameters directly instead of plucking
them out of `GoRouterState`.

**Before** (go_router):

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/products/:id',
  builder: (context, state) {
    final id = state.pathParameters['id']!;
    return ProductDetailScreen(id: id);
  },
),
```

**After** (kaisel):

```dart
// 1. Define the route in your sealed hierarchy.
final class ProductDetail extends AppRoute {
  const ProductDetail(this.id);
  final String id;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [id];
}

// 2. Handle it in the config's page builder (the `builder:` from step 1).
KaiselRouterConfig<AppRoute>(
  initial: const Home(),
  builder: (context, route) => switch (route) {
    Home() => const HomeScreen(),
    ProductDetail(:final id) => ProductDetailScreen(id: id),
    // ... other routes
  },
);
```

The compiler now enforces that you've handled every variant —
the `switch` errors if you add a new sealed subclass and forget
to update the builder. Path-shaped strings disappear from this
layer entirely. They reappear (if you need them) in the codec.

Group your routes into a single sealed hierarchy:

```dart
sealed class AppRoute extends KaiselRoute {
  const AppRoute();
}

final class Home extends AppRoute {
  const Home();
}

final class ProductList extends AppRoute {
  const ProductList({this.category});
  final String? category;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [category];
}

final class ProductDetail extends AppRoute {
  const ProductDetail(this.id);
  final String id;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [id];
}
```

### 3. Replace path/query parameters with constructor fields

Anywhere you read `state.pathParameters['something']` or
`state.uri.queryParameters['filter']`, the value becomes a field on
the route class. Optional params become nullable fields with
defaults; required params become required positional or named args.

**Before** (go_router):

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/products',
  builder: (context, state) {
    final category = state.uri.queryParameters['category'];
    final sortBy = state.uri.queryParameters['sort'] ?? 'name';
    return ProductListScreen(category: category, sortBy: sortBy);
  },
),
```

**After** (kaisel):

```dart
final class ProductList extends AppRoute {
  const ProductList({this.category, this.sortBy = 'name'});
  final String? category;
  final String sortBy;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [category, sortBy];
}
```

URL parsing moves into the codec (step 6). The route itself just
holds the data.

### 4. Replace `redirect:` with a guard pipeline

go_router's `redirect:` callback returns a path string (or `null`).
kaisel's guards return a stack. The conceptual difference is that
a guard can express things a redirect can't — it sees the entire
proposed stack, not just the destination.

**Before** (go_router):

```dart
GoRouter(
  redirect: (context, state) {
    final loggingIn = state.matchedLocation == '/login';
    if (!isLoggedIn && !loggingIn) {
      return '/login';
    }
    return null;
  },
  routes: [...],
);
```

**After** (kaisel):

```dart
List<AppRoute> authGuard(List<AppRoute> current, List<AppRoute> proposed) {
  final headingToLogin = proposed.any((r) => r is Login);
  if (!isLoggedIn && !headingToLogin) {
    return [const Login()];
  }
  return proposed;
}

final _config = KaiselRouterConfig<AppRoute>(
  initial: isLoggedIn ? const Home() : const Login(),
  builder: (context, route) => switch (route) { /* ... */ },
  guards: [authGuard],
);
```

Multiple cross-cutting concerns compose as a list of guards, each
receiving the output of the previous:

```dart
KaiselRouterConfig<AppRoute>(
  initial: const Home(),
  builder: (context, route) => switch (route) { /* ... */ },
  guards: [authGuard, featureFlagGuard, entitlementGuard],
)
```

This is closer to a function pipeline than to "callbacks attached
to routes" — and that's the point. Per-route guards in go_router's
model (which it doesn't directly support, only at the top level)
are awkward because the route is the wrong place to express
cross-cutting concerns. The pipeline expresses them once, applies
them everywhere.

### 5. Translate `ShellRoute` / `StatefulShellRoute`

If you're on `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`, this maps cleanly to
`KaiselBranchedShell`. If you're on the non-stateful `ShellRoute`,
the migration changes the runtime behavior (per-tab state is now
preserved), so plan accordingly.

**Before** (go_router):

```dart
StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack(
  builder: (context, state, navigationShell) => ScaffoldWithNavBar(
    navigationShell: navigationShell,
  ),
  branches: [
    StatefulShellBranch(routes: [
      GoRoute(path: '/home', builder: ...),
    ]),
    StatefulShellBranch(routes: [
      GoRoute(path: '/products', builder: ...),
      GoRoute(path: '/products/:id', builder: ...),
    ]),
  ],
);
```

**After** (kaisel):

```dart
// Per-branch sealed routes.
sealed class HomeRoute extends KaiselRoute { const HomeRoute(); }
final class HomeView extends HomeRoute { const HomeView(); }

sealed class ProductRoute extends KaiselRoute { const ProductRoute(); }
final class ProductList extends ProductRoute { const ProductList(); }
final class ProductDetail extends ProductRoute {
  const ProductDetail(this.id);
  final String id;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [id];
}

// Declarative branched shell — the shell owns the per-branch routers.
KaiselBranchedShell.specs(
  branches: [
    KaiselBranchSpec<HomeRoute>(
      initial: const HomeView(),
      builder: (c, r) => switch (r) {
        HomeView() => const HomeScreen(),
      },
    ),
    KaiselBranchSpec<ProductRoute>(
      initial: const ProductList(),
      builder: (c, r) => switch (r) {
        ProductList() => const ProductListScreen(),
        ProductDetail(:final id) => ProductDetailScreen(id: id),
      },
    ),
  ],
  chromeBuilder: (context, activeBranch, branchContent, switchBranch) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: branchContent,
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
        currentIndex: activeBranch,
        onTap: switchBranch,
        items: const [/* ... */],
      ),
    );
  },
);
```

`KaiselBranchedShell.specs` is the natural target for migrating
`StatefulShellRoute`: you declare each branch's initial route and
builder, and the shell owns the per-branch routers for you — no
manual `KaiselRouter` or `BranchedShellRouter` to wire. (The
explicit `KaiselBranchedShell(shell:, branches: [KaiselBranch(...)])`
form is still available as the lower tier when you need to hold the
routers yourself.)

Per-branch typing is doing real work here. Each `KaiselBranchSpec`
is typed to that tab's sealed family, so the branch's own router is
too — the compiler will reject pushing a `ProductDetail` into the
home branch as a type error. This is the type safety go_router's
table can't give you even with codegen. From inside a branch, reach
the shell with `context.shell()` (a `KaiselShellController`:
`.switchTo(i)`, `.activeBranch`, `.branchCount`, `.current`).
For an adaptive branch, use `KaiselBranchSpec.adaptive(initial:, builder:)`.

### 6. Wire up the codec

This is the step that doesn't exist in the auto_route guide because
auto_route already has typed routes and a codegen-driven parser.
go_router migration almost always needs this step because you
likely have deep links to maintain.

If you don't use deep links at all, omit `codec:` from
`KaiselRouterConfig` entirely — the app stays URL-less and there's no
parser to write.

If you do, write a real codec and pass it as `codec:` (with an
optional `fallback:`). `KaiselRouterConfig` wires the
route-information parser and `PlatformRouteInformationProvider` for
you. The codec maps `Uri ↔ KaiselConfig`:

```dart
class AppCodec extends KaiselConfigCodec<AppRoute> {
  @override
  KaiselConfig<AppRoute> decode(Uri uri) {
    return switch (uri.pathSegments) {
      [] || ['home'] => KaiselConfig(mainStack: [const Home()]),
      ['products'] => KaiselConfig(
        mainStack: [const Home(), const ProductList()],
      ),
      ['products', final id] => KaiselConfig(
        mainStack: [const Home(), const ProductList(), ProductDetail(id)],
      ),
      _ => KaiselConfig(mainStack: [const Home()]),  // 404 fallback
    };
  }

  @override
  Uri encode(KaiselConfig<AppRoute> config) {
    final top = config.mainStack.last;
    return switch (top) {
      Home() => Uri(path: '/home'),
      ProductList() => Uri(path: '/products'),
      ProductDetail(:final id) => Uri(path: '/products/$id'),
    };
  }
}
```

The pattern matching in `decode` is exhaustive on the level you
specify (path segments), and the encoder is exhaustive on your
sealed type — if you add a new route variant and forget to give it
a URL, the compiler tells you.

A note on what to do about routes that *don't* have URL forms. If
`ProductDetail` is reachable in two ways — by id (URL-routable) and
by full model (in-app push only) — you express that as sealed
variants of the same destination:

```dart
sealed class ProductDetail extends AppRoute {
  const ProductDetail();
}
final class ProductDetailById extends ProductDetail {
  const ProductDetailById(this.id);
  final String id;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [id];
}
final class ProductDetailWithModel extends ProductDetail {
  const ProductDetailWithModel(this.product);
  final Product product;
}
```

The codec only handles `ProductDetailById`. The other variant is
in-app only, and the screen pattern-matches on which it received.
This replaces go_router's `extra` field with something type-checked.

## What's now at parity

A few things that used to be on this list have landed, and they're
the ones that mattered most for go_router users:

**`context.push` ergonomics.** The terse `context.*` verbs —
`context.push`, `context.pop`, `context.replaceTop`,
`context.pushOrReplaceTop`, `context.set`, and `await context.run<T>(...)`
— give you go_router-shaped call sites. They resolve the nearest
router whose route type accepts the argument at runtime, so
`context.push(const ProductDetail('42'))` "just works" from anywhere
in the tree, the way `context.push('/products/42')` does. The trade
is that a wrong-family route throws at runtime instead of compile
time — so kaisel treats the typed `context.router<AppRoute>().push(...)`
as the idiomatic default (the family is compile-checked) and the terse
`context.push(...)` as the go_router-shaped convenience you reach for
when the brevity is worth that trade.

**`routerConfig` setup.** `KaiselRouterConfig` is a `RouterConfig`
you hand to `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig:)`, declared as a
top-level `final` — the exact shape of `final _router = GoRouter(...)`.
No `StatefulWidget`, no manual delegate or parser. See step 1.

**Typed results from a screen.** `await context.pushForResult<T>(SomeScreen())`
returns a value from a normal main-stack route (resolved with
`context.pop(value)`) — the direct analogue of go_router's
`await context.push<T>('/edit')`. `run<T>` is the heavier tool, for multi-screen
modal flows.

**Lazy / deferred shell branches.** `KaiselBranchedShell.specs(lazy: true)` builds
tabs on first visit and keeps them alive — the `StatefulShellRoute` lazy-first
model — and `KaiselBranchSpec.deferred` code-splits a tab behind a `deferred as`
import (placeholder, error builder with retry, then the screen).

**DevTools extension.** kaisel ships its own zero-integration DevTools extension —
a live inspector of the stack, shells, modules, flows, guard trace, and a
transitions log showing the call site behind each navigation. Open DevTools in
any debug run.

## What kaisel doesn't yet do at parity

Be honest with yourself about whether these matter before migrating.

**Browser history replace-vs-push.** Browser back/forward and deep links work —
each navigation round-trips through the codec, so back restores the previous
stack. kaisel mirrors go_router's replace-vs-push control: `replaceTop` / `set`
(and the replace half of `pushOrReplaceTop`) **replace** the current browser
history entry — so a splash or interstitial stays out of the back stack — while
`push` and `pop` add one. For browser Back/Forward that mirror the app stack
across several pops, reach for `context.back()` / `context.historyGo(delta)`
instead of `pop`.

**`errorBuilder:`.** go_router has a built-in error page when no
route matches. kaisel doesn't have a separate slot; you add an
error route to your sealed type and fall through to it in the codec:

```dart
final class NotFound extends AppRoute {
  const NotFound(this.uri);
  final Uri uri;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [uri];
}

// In codec.decode:
_ => KaiselConfig(mainStack: [NotFound(uri)]),
```

It's slightly more code but it makes errors first-class routes,
which means you can navigate to them, log them, instrument them.

**Initial location from a saved state.** go_router's
`initialLocation` parameter has straightforward semantics. kaisel's
`initial` takes a route, not a URL — to launch from a saved URL,
you decode it through the codec yourself before constructing the
router.

## Migration strategy: big bang, not incremental

You can technically run both routers side by side in the same app
(two `MaterialApp.router`s in a tree), but you almost never want
to. The complexity isn't worth it for any app smaller than a
hundred screens. The recommendation is: pick a week, branch from
main, do the rewrite, regression-test, ship.

The reason big-bang is the right answer is that route-related code
in your app is more interconnected than you remember. Every screen
that uses `context.go(...)` / `context.push(...)` is coupled to your
route table. Every
guard touches the redirect callback. Every deep link touches the
parser. Switching the router under any of these means switching
them all. There's no clean line to draw across the codebase that
lets half stay on go_router and half move to kaisel.

If you can't afford a one-week branch, you can't afford the
migration yet — wait for a quieter sprint.

## A worked example diff

A small app — Home + ProductList + ProductDetail + Login + a
StatefulShellRoute with two tabs + auth redirect — typically loses
about 20% of its routing-related code on migration. The string
paths disappear, the redirect callback compresses into a single
guard function, and the route table becomes a switch expression.
The largest single addition is the codec, which is new code that
didn't exist in the go_router version.

The example folder in this repo contains
[`main.dart`](../../example/lib/main.dart),
[`main_shell_adaptive.dart`](../../example/lib/main_shell_adaptive.dart),
and [`main_media_cataloguer.dart`](../../example/lib/main_media_cataloguer.dart) —
they demonstrate the same patterns this guide describes. If you're
stuck on how a specific go_router construct translates, scan those
for a working analogue.

## More questions

File an issue at the [kaisel repo][2] with the go_router construct
you can't figure out how to translate. Migration-shaped questions
are the highest-value GitHub conversations to have right now —
they inform what this guide should cover next, and they help shape
the parser API as it firms up toward v1.0.
