# OpenTelemetry observer

This reference matches `bloc_signals_otel` 0.2.3.

## Setup

Install one observer before creating or dispatching to blocs:

```dart
import 'package:bloc_signals/bloc_signals.dart';
import 'package:bloc_signals_otel/bloc_signals_otel.dart';

void main() {
  BlocSignalObserver.observer = OtelBlocSignalObserver();
  runApp(const App());
}
```

Pass a tracer in tests or when the application owns tracer configuration:

```dart
BlocSignalObserver.observer = OtelBlocSignalObserver(tracer: tracer);
```

The global observer is a single slot. Compose observers in application code when logging, crash
reporting, and OpenTelemetry must all receive the same events.

## Span lifecycle

`onEvent` starts a span named `<BlocType>.add(<EventType>)` with `bloc.type` and `event.type` string
attributes.

`onTransition` finds the span by bloc and event identity, writes `state.value` using
`state.toString()`, marks the span successful, and ends it.

`onError` ends every active span for the failing bloc with an error status and recorded exception.
When that bloc has no active span, it creates and immediately ends `<BlocType>.error`.

Observer hooks accept `BlocSignalBase<dynamic>`, so the same observer receives `BlocSignal` and
`CubitSignal` transitions and errors. A cubit has no event dispatch span. Its ordinary transitions
carry a null event, and a reported cubit error with no active span produces a standalone
`<CubitType>.error` span.

`OtelBlocSignalObserver` overrides `onClose` to purge and end lingering active spans associated with the closed container, preventing memory accumulation upon disposal.

## Completion gaps

An event that emits no state, emits only an equal state, or waits indefinitely does not produce
`onTransition`. Its span remains in the observer's active map until an error for that bloc occurs,
the bloc is closed via `onClose`, or the map reaches its capacity limit (default 100 entries) and evicts the oldest span.

Account for this behavior before using the observer for latency or completion metrics. Do not add a
timer in application code merely to make traces look complete; fix the observer contract or model
the operation with a span owned by the operation itself.

## Data safety

`state.value` records `state.toString()`. Review state types for personal data, tokens, large
payloads, and high-cardinality identifiers before enabling export. Prefer a custom observer or a
safe state representation when the default string is unsuitable.

Errors close all active spans for the same bloc, not only the event that failed. Concurrent async
events therefore need a focused trace test if exact event-to-error correlation matters.

## Test expectations

Use an in-memory exporter and assert:

- span name and type attributes;
- the state attribute on a non-equal transition;
- error status and recorded exception;
- fallback `CubitSignal` error span behavior;
- fallback error span behavior;
- eviction behavior when active spans exceed the cap;
- the no-transition case when an equal state is emitted.

Reset `BlocSignalObserver.observer` and shut down the tracer provider after each test.
Await each bloc's `close()` future during cleanup.
